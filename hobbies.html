            <h2>The section below outlines several of my personal interests. (Option 1)</h2>
            <p>
                While the presentation here is more casual and informal in tone,
                it is intended to offer additional perspective on my personality, creativity, and interests beyond academic and professional work.
            </p>
            <h2>Here are a few of my hobbies! (Option 2)</h2>
            <p>
                This section takes a more relaxed and informal tone than the rest of my site,
                but I hope it offers a clearer picture of who I am beyond work.
                Who knows — if you look closely, you might even notice that I bring the same level of effort and dedication to my hobbies as I do to my professional pursuits.

            <h2>Triathlon</h2>
            <p>
                Triathlon has become one of my favorite sports. I find the training incredibly rewarding—there's a clear connection between the effort I put in and the improvements I see in my fitness. I enjoy pushing my limits during races as a way to challenge myself and prove what I'm capable of. While I'm proud of all my races, my favorite is the personal triathlon I complete every year on my birthday. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started this tradition in 2024 at age 19 and plan to continue it for as long as I can. The format is simple: I swim <code>x</code> * 100m, bike <code>x</code> * 5km, and run <code>x</code> * 1km—where <code>x</code> is my age. Since these exact distances don't match any official race, I complete it on my own, which adds an extra level of challenge and meaning.
            </p>

            <h2>Backpacking & Canoe-Camping</h2>
            <p>
                In 2024, I went on my first backpacking trip, and it was an unforgettable experience. We hiked 30 km over three days with heavy packs through the crisp October weather in Frontenac Park. I quickly fell in love with the trails and the peacefulness of nature—I didn't want to leave.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2025, I planned to go backpacking again, but a stress fracture forced a change of plans. Instead, I rented a canoe and went canoe-camping. It turned out to be an equally rewarding way to explore the outdoors, and now both activities have become important parts of how I connect with nature.
            </p>

            <h2>Trips</h2>
            <p>
                In 2025, I took my first trip abroad—to Portugal—and absolutely loved it. My girlfriend and I focused on meaningful experiences throughout the two-week adventure. I hiked a 300m mountain to a castle in Sintra, walked along the stunning cliffs in Lagos, kayaked in its coastal waters, biked 80 km across rough terrain, and even learned to surf near Porto.
            </p>
            <p>
                That trip sparked a passion for travel, and I'm excited to explore more of the world in the years to come.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>
                Reading is a passion I've recently reconnected with. I realized I was spending too much time on my phone and found that I'm much more focused and motivated when I leave it behind. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To break that habit, I turned back to something I loved growing up—getting lost in books. It's been a great way to unwind, learn, and stay present, and I've been steadily building it back into my routine.
