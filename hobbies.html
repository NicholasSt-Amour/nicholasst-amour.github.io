                While the presentation here is more casual and informal in tone,
                it is intended to offer additional perspective on my personality, creativity, and interests beyond academic and professional work.
            </p>
            <h2>Here are a few of my hobbies! (Option 2)</h2>
            <p>
                This section takes a more relaxed and informal tone than the rest of my site,
                but I hope it offers a clearer picture of who I am beyond work.
                Who knows â€” if you look closely, you might even notice that I bring the same level of effort and dedication to my hobbies as I do to my professional pursuits.
